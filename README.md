# Sudoku Solver

This project is a Sudoku Solver developed using PyTorch for deep learning, NumPy for computations, and OpenCV for image processing. The application can detect, extract, and solve Sudoku puzzles from images using a backtracking algorithm.




## Features

#### Image Processing: Uses OpenCV to detect and extract Sudoku grids from images.
#### Deep Learning: Utilizes PyTorch for solving Sudoku puzzles.
#### Computations: Employs NumPy for efficient numerical operations.
#### Algorithm: Implements a backtracking algorithm to solve puzzles.
